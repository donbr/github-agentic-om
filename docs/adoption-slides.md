# ✅ **3. Executive Slide Summary (3–5 Slides)**  
Aimed at CTOs / Directors / Platform Leads.  
You can copy & paste directly into a slide deck.

---

### **Slide 1 — Title**
# **GitHub-Native Operating Model for Human + AI Engineering Teams**

A governance and workflow framework enabling safe, high-velocity contributions from human engineers and AI agents inside GitHub.

---

### **Slide 2 — Why This Model Exists**

- AI agents are becoming **true software contributors**  
- Organizations lack a **safe, predictable way** to onboard them  
- GitHub already provides all necessary primitives  
- We need **structure, not new platforms**  
- This model defines the **minimum viable governance** for hybrid teams

---

### **Slide 3 — Core Principles**

- **GitHub is the control plane**  
- **PR-first workflow** ensures safety  
- **Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation**  
- AI agents follow **exact same workflow** as humans  
- Branch protection + rule files = **guardrails**  
- Humans control **approval & risk**  
- Agents accelerate delivery & improve consistency

---

### **Slide 4 — What AI Agents Can Do**

**Allowed:**
- Implement features from specs  
- Create branches & PRs (with naming rules)  
- Improve tests & docs  
- Enforce patterns & consistency  
- Perform hygiene/refactoring tasks  

**Restricted:**
- No merging into protected branches  
- No admin rights  
- No architectural decisions without approval  
- No bypassing governance

### **Slide 5 — Adoption Phases (30-Day Rollout)**

**Phase 0** — Preparation  
Human alignment, branch protection, Spec Kit.

**Phase 1** — Humans-Only  
PR templates, folder patterns, docs, governance.

**Phase 2** — AI-Assisted  
Agents help on human branches, no autonomous PRs.

**Phase 3** — AI as Contributors  
AI-authored branches & PRs with review gates.

**Phase 4** — Optimization  
Optional automation: labels, policy gates, cleanup jobs.
