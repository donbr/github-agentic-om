# Core Rule: Trunk-Based, PR-First Workflow (v1.0.0)

## Purpose
Follow current GitHub best practices:
- main is the single trunk.
- All work happens on short-lived branches.
- All changes merge into main via Pull Requests only.
- Branches are deleted after merge.

## Branching
- Assume main is the trunk.
- Do not commit directly to main unless the user insists AND change is trivial.
- Always create a short-lived branch for non-trivial work.

Preferred patterns:
    feature/<task-or-topic>
    bugfix/<issue-or-bug>
    refactor/<area>
    docs/<topic>

Example workflow:
    git switch -c feature/<short-tag>-<description>

## Commits
- Small, focused commits.
- Imperative messages.

## Pull Requests
Use this PR structure:

    ## Summary
    - <1–3 bullets>

    ## Context
    - <why this exists>

    ## Implementation Details
    - <design choices>

    ## Testing
    - <validation steps>

    ## Risks & Rollback
    - <revert plan>

## Validation
- Explain which files will change and why.
- Suggest validation steps.
