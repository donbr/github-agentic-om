# Agentic Rule: AI Contributors Must Follow PR-First Workflow (v1.0.0)

## Branch Creation
AI agents MUST:
- Work only on short-lived branches.
- Never commit directly to main.

## PR Requirements
AI-generated PRs must include:

    - Reasoning summary
    - Implementation details
    - Validation steps
    - Risk assessment

## Commit Behavior
- Commit small, incremental changes.
- Avoid multi-file sweeping rewrites unless the user requests it.

## Safety
- Respect protected main branch.
- Use PRs as the human-in-the-loop safety checkpoint.
