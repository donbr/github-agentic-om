# Repo Rule: Branching & Workflow Conventions (v1.0.0)

This repository follows trunk-based, PR-first GitHub workflows.

## Branch Names
Use short-lived branches:

    feature/<id-or-topic>-<short-description>
    bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>
    refactor/<area>
    docs/<topic>

Examples:
    feature/143-improve-auth-flow
    bugfix/77-fix-dataset-schema

## Editing Constraints
- Keep diffs small.
- Avoid structural rewrites unless requested.
- Prefer multiple small PRs over one large one.

## PR Expectations
Use this PR template:

    ## Summary
    - <bullets>

    ## Context
    - <why>

    ## Implementation Details
    - <choices>

    ## Testing
    - <steps>
    - If not tested, explain.

    ## Risks & Rollback
    - <impact>
    - <revert>

## Validation & Quality
- Recommend appropriate tests.
- Ensure alignment with trunk-based workflow.
