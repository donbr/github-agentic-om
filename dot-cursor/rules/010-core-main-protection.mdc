# Core Rule: Protect main as the Trunk (v1.0.0)

## Goal
Treat main as protected and always-deployable.
Changes must enter main via Pull Requests.

## Behavior on main
- If current branch is main, avoid edits.
- For significant changes, direct user to create a feature branch:

      git switch -c feature/<short-tag>-<description>

## Safety
- Do not suggest force pushes unless explicitly requested.
- Encourage:

      git status
      git diff
      git log --oneline
